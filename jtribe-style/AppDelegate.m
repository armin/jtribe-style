// STYLE: Keep the app delegate clean and lean. Use a RootViewController if you need to handle general routing logic across the app. (ask a jtribe developer about RootViewControllers and how to use them)

// STYLE: remove the delegate methods that are not used. A good developer will know how to find them in the header file when needed.
